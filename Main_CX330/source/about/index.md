# Whoami

Hello world. My name is **Blake Chen**, and the IDs I often use in the cyber world are **CX330** & **The Star** (since CX330 is hard to pronounce). I am currently a college student, majoring in computer science. I want to become a really great hacker, just like Condor or The Mentor.

Also, I'm a perfectionist. So that's why I always try to optimize everything in my short life. Every time I can't reach my expectations, I'll be a little upset, although I know that it's not possible to let everything being perfect. Due to this, I sometimes try too hard and make a lot of things overflow, such as my brain, my schedule, my emotions, etc.

Knowing that I'm just an ordinary person, I often wonder if my dreams are too big or too ambitious. But even so, I'll still keep trying to reach the goals just because of fun and my curiousity.

# Why CX330

> "CX330 is the most isolated young star that has been discovered." — **_NASA_**

As NASA researchers mentioned, CX330 is a young and isolated star. I chose it as my ID because I deeply understand the importance of embracing solitude on the path to becoming a hacker. Only in solitude can I achieve a state of complete focus, and this intense isolation allows me to reach a state of flow. I hope this ID constantly reminds me to cherish and enjoy every moment of solitude, aspiring to become a young and brilliant star (and that's why I say you can call me The Star).

# My Dreams

I have a lot of dreams so it's hard to list all of them here. But one of them is that I hope one day I can become a hacker remembered by the world.

I'm not a good hacker yet, and I also don't know how long it will take to become one. But the one thing I know is that I will keep staying on my path. Even if people laugh at me and don't believe in me, I still believe in myself and my talent. Yes, I'm not the smartest. But I'm the one who has dreams. And to achieve them, I will keep learning and keep hacking.

I hope one day, people will remember my name and my ID, remember **Blake Chen**, remeber The Star, remeber **CX330**.
